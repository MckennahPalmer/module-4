# Overview

I am learning SQL and practicing all the different database commands to build my skill with it.

A lot of little examples about queries, inserting, updating, altering, and deleting.

My goal was to mainly learn SQL and then try to build a script that would make SQL queries to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL

# Relational Database

I got the MySQL extention for Visual Studios. You need to have an account for the MySQL website to actually make a database and run your queries. 

I created 2 tables. 1 simple without constraints, and the other a bit more complex with constraints. The first table is named table_name with columns that have just one row. The second table, authors, has 5 columns where the data has to be given so it is not null or there is a default that automatically fills it in when you insert.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studios for the environment, and MySQL for the database.

Javascript and SQL for the code.
